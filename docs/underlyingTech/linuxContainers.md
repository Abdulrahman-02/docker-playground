# Linux Containers (LXC)

Linux Containers (LXC) serve as the foundation for Docker. LXC is a lightweight virtualization solution that allows multiple isolated Linux systems to run on a single host without the need for a full-fledged hypervisor. LXC effectively isolates applications and their dependencies in a secure and optimized manner.
