# Using Third Party Images: Databases

Running your database in a Docker container can help streamline your development process and ease deployment. Docker Hub provides numerous pre-made images for popular databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

## Example: Using MySQL Image

To use a MySQL database, search for the official image on Docker Hub:

```bash
docker search mysql
```

Find the official image, and pull it:

```bash
docker pull mysql
```

Now, you can run a MySQL container. Specify the required environment variables, such as MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, and optionally map the containerâ€™s port to your host machine:

```bash
docker run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -p 3306:3306 -d mysql
```

This command creates a new container named some-mysql, sets the root password to my-secret-pw, and maps port 3306 on the host to port 3306 on the container.
